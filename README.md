# install-go
Shell scripts for compiling Go from source or installing and updating Go.  These are consistent with the instructions on https://golang.org/doc/install

These scripts should be run as the user for which you want Go.  __Do not run as `sudo`__.  This breaks things.

## install_current
Installs the current release of Go to `/usr/local/go`.  The `$GOPATH` is set to `~/go` and the directory is created.  `$GOPATH`, `$GOPATH/bin`, and  `/usr/local/go/bin` are added to the `~/.bashrc` file.

## install_go
This script is a copy of [Eric Lagergren's](https://github.com/EricLagergren) [InstallGo](https://gist.github.com/EricLagergren/ddea0f327d38f8c3a918) script.  It allows for the specification of the Go version to install along with the OS and arch.

### Help output
This is the help output of the script, which provides all of the information needed to use it:

```
Usage: ./install_go.sh [OPTIONS] versions...

  Versions must be valid Go version numbers.
  (E.g., 1.5.3, 1.6, 1.4.2, etc.)

  -o, --goos        specify the operating system to download
  -a, --goarch      specify the architecture to download
  -p, --possible    print possible GOOS/GOARCH combinations
  -v, --version     print version
  -h, --help        print help message

```
